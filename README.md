# Carpooling-System-Networking-CaseStudy


## Introduction
Carpooling System is a project which is based on Computer Networking topics. It describes how a network works in the background that is not easily shown in a system. It talks about socket programming, networking protocols, sliding protols, packet tracing and such.

## Platform Used
For Socket Programming: <br />
<ul>
  <li>PyCharm</li>
</ul>

For Packet Tracing: <br />
<ul>
  <li>Cisco Packet Tracer</li>
</ul>

## CaseStudy Process
Socket Programming
<ul>
  <li>Design a Client-Server based System</li>
  <li>Perform certain operations related to the chosen system</li>
  <li>Fetch the details into an excel sheet</li>
</ul>
Packet Tracing
<ul>
  <li>Perform subnetting on the chosen IP address block</li>
  <li>Perform Variable Length Subnet Mask calculation</li>
  <li>Assign the IP subnets to the sub-divisions in the system</li>
  <li>Perform RIP routing protocol</li>
  <li>Perform VLAN protocol</li>
  <li>Check for the Routing Algortihm</li>
</ul>  

## Important Attributes
<ul>
  <li>The subnetting performed in the case study is not continuous as the sscale of the network considered is very small. The joining of employees is very indefinite. To maintain clarity in the division of IP addresses, continuous subnetting is being dodged.</li>
  <li>Routers are assigned with class A IP addresses
      Remaining devices are assigned with class C IP addresses</li>
  <li>Nodes are being recorded. Refer the <a href = "https://github.com/Rhuthvik-D/Carpooling-System-Networking-Project/blob/main/Documentation/Carpooling%20Booking%20System.pdf">Documnetation</a></li>
